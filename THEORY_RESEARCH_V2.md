Executive Summary

A comprehensive literature review confirms that the five core dimensions (Assertiveness, Sociability, Conscientiousness, Flexibility/Adaptability, and Emotional Intelligence) are grounded in established personality theory. For example, Assertiveness and Sociability are well-documented facets of the Big Five Extraversion factor ￼ ￼, and Conscientiousness corresponds directly to Big Five Conscientiousness ￼. Flexibility/Adaptability aligns broadly with Openness to Experience and low Neuroticism (emotional stability) ￼, while Emotional Intelligence has been linked to low Neuroticism and high Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness ￼. Notably, traditional models also include Agreeableness and Neuroticism, which our core list omits; these are partly captured in Emotional Intelligence (empathy) and via stress/“usual vs. stressed” profiling. Leading frameworks confirm these overlaps: for example, DiSC’s Dominance style mirrors Assertiveness ￼, and DiSC Conscientiousness matches our Conscientiousness ￼. Across systems, Assertiveness/Sociability map to Extraversion ￼ ￼, Conscientiousness to Conscientiousness ￼, and Adaptability to Openness/Resilience ￼.

We identified four new dimensions with strong academic support: Creativity/Innovation, Risk Appetite, Values & Motivation, and Work Style Preference. Creativity links closely to Openness and divergent thinking ￼ ￼; trait-creativity scales (e.g. the Williams Creative Aptitude Test) measure facets like imagination, curiosity, and risk-taking ￼ ￼. Risk appetite is often captured by sensation-seeking or reward-sensitivity scales (e.g. Zuckerman’s Sensation-Seeking, Gray’s BIS/BAS) and relates to career entrepreneurship (though stress generally blunts reward sensitivity ￼). Values and motivation frameworks (Schwartz’s 10 values; Self-Determination Theory’s Autonomy/Competence/Relatedness) provide a basis for work values. For instance, creative individuals prioritize “Openness-to-Change” values (Self-Direction, Stimulation) over “Conservation” (Security, Conformity) ￼. Finally, research on work styles (e.g. person–environment fit) shows that Autonomy, structure, social environment, and sensory factors strongly influence satisfaction ￼ ￼ ￼. We incorporate these into the tool as new scored dimensions with concrete behaviors.

For MBTI integration, meta-analyses show clear Big Five correlations: MBTI Extraversion-Introversion ⇔ Big Five Extraversion; Sensing–Intuition ⇔ Openness; Thinking–Feeling ⇔ Agreeableness; Judging–Perceiving ⇔ Conscientiousness ￼ ￼. No MBTI axis captures Neuroticism. These alignments allow Big Five scores to predict MBTI preferences (though type assignment remains noisy). Given MBTI’s reliability criticisms, it should be used only as a supplementary “cognitive style” layer, not a primary trait framework. We’ll report MBTI in descriptive, non-definitive language and emphasize individual variability ￼.

Making the test neurodivergence-friendly is critical. Research finds ADHD correlates with high Neuroticism and low Conscientiousness, Extraversion and Agreeableness ￼, while Autism is associated with very low Extraversion (introversion), Conscientiousness, and Openness ￼. Traditional tests often penalize these traits. Best practices include using clear, concrete language (avoiding idioms), shorter or modular sections, and optional accommodations (e.g. read-aloud, extended time). The assessment should frame results as strengths-based; for example, ADHD individuals often show creativity, high energy and “hyperfocus” on interests ￼, which can be highlighted as assets. We recommend not explicitly scoring ADHD/autism (this isn’t a diagnostic tool), but ensuring all questions are written plainly and neutrally so as not to misinterpret neurodivergent response patterns.

Regarding work environment fit, evidence is mixed on personality-job matching: one meta-analysis found only weak links between personality type and satisfaction ￼. Instead, factors like autonomy, feedback, task clarity, and social support are robust predictors of job satisfaction ￼ ￼. Nonetheless, surface preferences matter: e.g., Extroverts gain energy from collaboration, whereas Introverts prefer quiet focus ￼ ￼. Sensory sensitivity is also key: open offices often stress introverts/neurodivergents ￼ ￼. Our tool will therefore gauge preferences for pace, structure, social interaction, and sensory environment, grounded in person–environment fit research ￼ ￼.

In comparing creative vs. corporate professionals, studies show creatives (artists, designers, musicians) score significantly higher on Openness, divergent thinking, and intrinsic motivation ￼. Creative professionals also identify strongly with creative values (passion for craft, autonomy) and hold a growth mindset ￼, whereas corporate professionals often emphasize Security, Achievement and external recognition ￼. We will tailor some items to capture these nuances.

From user feedback on existing tests, common themes emerge. Positive points include: self-awareness and communication tips. One user noted, “I love these tests… I especially like that many give tips on how to communicate with different types of people.” ￼. Tests can facilitate team cohesion (discussing how colleagues prefer feedback, etc.) ￼ ￼. Users appreciate when results highlight communication strategies or strengths rather than labels ￼.

However, users often criticize tests as vague, superficial or rigid. They report: “They all seemed rather undefining and vague… I can answer both answers at any time … I can get any result and I wouldn’t be lying. This is ridiculous.” ￼. Neurodivergent users find standard tests especially frustrating, calling them “neurotypical, anti-neurodivergent” and complaining that results vary wildly day-to-day ￼. Many also see them as overly deterministic or pseudo-scientific (“I LOATHE this pseudoscientific nonsense… I’d be worried if any workplace took them seriously.” ￼ ￼). Users hate “one-size-fits-all” categories and dread if assessments are used for hiring/promotions ￼ ￼.

Gaps users identify include lack of nuance and misalignment with real experiences. They want reports to acknowledge variability (“take what you want and discard the rest” ￼) and to offer tailored advice. Creative professionals report that many tests miss creativity-specific traits. For example, an Adobe “Creative Types” quiz was criticized as “subjective, vague… can get any result” ￼.

Quotes & Examples:
	•	“I love these tests… [they] give tips on how to communicate with different types… as a tool for team building and improving communication skills? Great!” ￼ (positive feedback).
	•	“They all seemed rather undefining and vague… I can answer both answers… this is ridiculous.” ￼ (criticism of vagueness).
	•	“These tests seem very neurotypical and anti-neurodivergent…I don’t want any other neurodivergent people to feel uncomfortable by these tests.” ￼ (neurodivergent perspective).

Design Recommendations based on feedback:
	•	Emphasize actionable insights, especially communication/strength tips ￼.
	•	Ensure flexibility: allow users to interpret results selectively (“take what you need” ￼).
	•	Avoid overly categorical language; stress traits on a continuum.
	•	Incorporate creativity-focused items for artists (e.g. preference for ambiguity, passion) as those resonate with creative users.
	•	Explicitly accommodate neurodiversity: use clear language, shorter sections, and optional formats. For instance, MBTI guidelines suggest highlighting ADHD strengths (creativity, hyperfocus) rather than deficits ￼.
	•	Do not use results for gatekeeping. Present them as discussion tools, not labels for “best career fit” ￼ ￼.

In summary, our research-backed framework will combine proven personality dimensions with new scales for creativity, risk, values, and work style, all calibrated for artists and professionals. We will present both dimensional scores and optional archetype/MBTI profiles in an inclusive, strengths-based manner that reflects real users’ needs and experiences.

Core Personality Dimensions

Assertiveness (Confidence & Initiative)

Definition: Assertiveness refers to one’s tendency to be bold, confident, and take charge in social or work situations. Assertive individuals express opinions directly and are proactive in pursuing goals ￼ ￼.

Theoretical Basis: In the Big Five model, Assertiveness is a facet of Extraversion ￼. People high in Big Five Extraversion are social and confident, while low-Assertive people (introverts) may be more reserved. In DiSC, the Dominance style describes assertive, decisive persons ￼. Personality inventories like the Hogan HPI include an Ambition (assertiveness) scale. Assertiveness is well-validated across frameworks: e.g. McCrae & Costa (1988) mapped MBTI’s E–I to Big Five Extraversion ￼, which subsumes assertiveness facets.

Measurement: Standard Big Five questionnaires (NEO-PI, IPIP) include items on confidence and leadership tendencies. Sample items: “I enjoy taking the lead in group settings,” or “I speak up even when others hesitate.” The DiSC “Dominance” assessment specifically measures assertiveness via situations like preference for challenge ￼. Possible assessment items:
	•	“I confidently share my ideas in a team meeting.”
	•	“I tend to initiate projects rather than wait for direction.”

Relevance to Creatives: Assertiveness helps artists and designers advocate for their vision and navigate the collaborative aspects of creative projects. However, some creatives are naturally introverted; thus, it’s important not to confuse low assertiveness with lack of capability. For instance, an artist may contribute innovative ideas without dominating discussion. We will ensure items distinguish confidence in ideas from general sociability.

Potential Questions/Indicators: Likert-scale prompts like “When working on a team project, I naturally take charge and assign tasks.” or “I feel comfortable speaking up about my opinions.” can indicate Assertiveness. Observations of initiative-taking (volunteering for leadership roles, confidently negotiating) could also be scored via scenario judgments.

Sociability (Interaction & Openness)

Definition: Sociability reflects one’s enjoyment of social interaction and ease in engaging with others. It includes being warm, talkative, and relationship-focused. Highly sociable people seek social settings; less sociable (more introverted) individuals prefer solitude or small groups ￼.

Theoretical Basis: Sociability corresponds to facets of Extraversion as well ￼. The Big Five aspect model even splits Extraversion into Enthusiasm (sociability) and Assertiveness ￼. In DiSC, the Influence style captures the talkative, persuasive, energetic aspect of sociability. The Birkman Method also assesses “Social Boldness.” No core trait system uses “Sociability” by that name, but it is firmly supported by extraversion research ￼ ￼.

Measurement: Personality inventories measure sociability via items like “I enjoy meeting new people” or “I like group activities.” Observationally, one might rate how often someone initiates conversation or participates in social events. Example indicators: “I often strike up conversations with strangers.” “I feel energized after social gatherings.”

Relevance to Creatives: In team settings (e.g. studio or agency), sociability aids networking and collaboration. Many creative projects require presenting ideas to others, so a moderate level of engagement is beneficial. However, highly introverted creatives (e.g. artists working in isolation) can still excel, so sociability is simply one trait among many. We will ask about openness to social engagement specifically in work contexts.

Potential Questions/Indicators: Items such as “I build professional relationships easily” or “I enjoy brainstorming ideas with others” can measure Sociability. Behavioral indicators could include frequency of team interactions or comfort in networking situations.

Conscientiousness (Organization & Dependability)

Definition: Conscientiousness is the tendency to be organized, reliable, and self-disciplined. It includes careful planning, attention to detail, and following through on commitments ￼. Conscientious people are punctual and responsible; low scorers may be spontaneous or disorganized.

Theoretical Basis: This is exactly one of the Big Five factors ￼. Big Five research confirms Conscientiousness is a strong predictor of work performance and goal achievement. DISC’s “Conscientiousness” style is similar, focusing on quality and accuracy. Notably, Big Five literature finds that low Conscientiousness can manifest as flexibility and spontaneity ￼, which ties into the Flexibility dimension below. Conscientiousness is universally recognized in personality taxonomy.

Measurement: Standard Big Five questionnaires include items like “I finish tasks on time,” “I keep my workspace neat,” or “I make schedules and stick to them.” Job-performance instruments often emphasize the same. Example indicators: “I plan my projects carefully in advance.” “Other people can rely on me to meet deadlines.”

Relevance to Creatives: Conscientiousness supports meeting project timelines and maintaining quality—valuable in both studio and corporate creative roles. However, overly rigid planning can stifle spontaneous creativity. Many creative professionals score moderately on Conscientiousness: enough to complete work, but they may allow for improvisation. Thus, our questions will assess dependability without penalizing creative spontaneity (e.g. “I set project goals and consistently work toward them.” rather than strictly “I follow procedures at all times.”)

Potential Questions/Indicators: Likert items like “I follow through on all parts of a project.”, or scenario-based questions about meeting a deadline. Team feedback might gauge reliability (e.g. “How often did this person turn in high-quality work on schedule?”).

Flexibility/Adaptability (Openness to Change & Resilience)

Definition: Flexibility (sometimes called Psychological Flexibility) denotes willingness to change course, adapt under pressure, and cope with novel situations. It combines openness to new ideas with emotional resilience when facing stress or unexpected challenges ￼.

Theoretical Basis: There is no single “Flexibility” Big Five factor, but it draws from Openness to Experience (curiosity, creative thinking) and low Neuroticism (emotional stability). Research shows resilience (a component of adaptability) correlates positively with Extraversion, Openness, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness, and negatively with Neuroticism ￼. In practice, adaptability is often treated as a facet of Openness or Conscientiousness, depending on the model. The 16PF includes “Openness to Change” scales. The concept of Cognitive Flexibility (not the same as personality flexibility) is distinct; here we focus on trait openness and resilience.

Measurement: Items might probe comfort with change: “I enjoy starting new projects even without a clear plan,” or “I stay calm and find solutions when things go wrong.” Resilience scales (e.g. CD-RISC) or Openness scales (imagination, variety) can serve as proxies. For example, ask “When faced with a sudden problem at work, I quickly adjust my approach.” Or rate reaction to change: “I welcome being assigned tasks outside my usual routine.”

Relevance to Creatives: Adaptability is critical in creative fields where briefs and trends change rapidly. Artists often need to revise work on feedback, so openness is key. However, too much volatility can hinder focus; we want to distinguish positive adaptability from chaotic indecision. In corporate roles (e.g. product design), adaptability means pivoting to market needs. We will measure both enthusiasm for new challenges and ability to stay composed under pressure.

Potential Questions/Indicators: Scenarios such as “Your team’s project requirements change suddenly. How do you react?” with multiple-choice options (embrace the change vs. resist it). Or statements like “I feel energized when adapting to new situations.” Observations might include how often one tries new methods or volunteers for novel tasks.

Emotional Intelligence (Empathy & Self-Awareness)

Definition: Emotional Intelligence (EI) is the capacity to perceive, understand, and manage one’s own emotions and those of others. It includes empathy (sensing others’ feelings), interpersonal sensitivity, and self-awareness of emotional states. Unlike the other dimensions, EI is not captured by the Big Five factors directly.

Theoretical Basis: EI is well-established in psychology (e.g. Mayer & Salovey, 1997; Bar-On, 1997). Meta-analytic evidence links trait EI strongly to low Neuroticism and high Extraversion, Conscientiousness, Agreeableness, and Openness ￼. In other words, emotionally intelligent people tend to be calm (low N), sociable, responsible, cooperative, and curious ￼. Existing measures include the Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire (TEIQue) and MSCEIT ability test. EI is also related to Big Five Agreeableness (compassion) and Conscientiousness (self-regulation).

Measurement: We can use proxy items like “I am aware of how my mood affects my productivity” or “I notice when colleagues are feeling stressed.” Well-validated EI scales ask about emotional management (e.g. “I remain calm under pressure”) and empathy (e.g. “I am good at sensing others’ feelings”). Interviews or 360-feedback could rate interpersonal insight.

Relevance to Creatives: EI is important for collaboration and client relations in creative roles. Empathy fuels audience insight (writers, designers often need to “feel” the user’s perspective). Self-awareness helps manage the emotional ups and downs of creative work. We will measure empathy (e.g. “I understand others’ perspectives on a project”) and self-regulation (e.g. “I can stay objective when receiving creative criticism”).

Potential Questions/Indicators: Sample items: “I can accurately gauge how my teammates are feeling during a project.”, “I stay composed even when deadlines are stressful.” Role-play scenarios (conflict resolution, giving feedback) could also assess EI.

Figure: The Big Five (OCEAN) factors (see above) – Assertiveness & Sociability are facets of Extraversion; Conscientiousness is itself; Flexibility maps to Openness/low Neuroticism; Emotional Intelligence correlates with low Neuroticism & high E, C, A ￼ ￼.

Core Dimension Mapping: In sum, our dimensions align closely with Big Five theory. Assertiveness and Sociability ⇒ Extraversion ￼ ￼. Conscientiousness ⇒ Conscientiousness ￼. Flexibility/Adaptability draws on Openness (novelty-seeking) and Neuroticism (resilience) ￼. Emotional Intelligence spans low Neuroticism (emotional stability) plus high Agreeableness (empathy) and Extraversion (social confidence) ￼. Notably, traditional Agreeableness is not explicitly a separate core dimension here, but elements of it (cooperation, trust) are partially covered by EI and Sociability. Likewise, pure Openness is partly covered by the Creativity/Innovation dimension we add. These choices reflect validated theory: for example, McCrae & Costa (1988) emphasize that Big Five comprehensively cover personality, and our factors neatly align with those five when combined with creativity and values measures ￼ ￼.

Creativity/Innovation (New Dimension)

Definition: Creativity/Innovation captures a person’s tendency to generate novel, useful ideas and to value originality. It includes curiosity, imagination, and a comfort with ambiguity and change. High scorers excel at divergent thinking and problem-solving in novel ways.

Research Basis: Creativity is a well-studied personality construct. The Big Five dimension Openness to Experience/Intellect is the strongest correlate of creative potential ￼ ￼. Kaufman et al. (2015) note that Openness predicts artistic creativity while Intellect predicts scientific creativity ￼ ￼. Moreover, studies list traits like imagination, curiosity, willingness to take risks, and norm-doubt as hallmarks of creative personalities ￼. For example, Davis (1992) and others found creative individuals often show imagination, curiosity, and risk-taking ￼. Creativity also ties to Intrinsic Motivation and a growth mindset (believing talent can develop) ￼.

Different Types of Creativity: Artistic creativity (e.g. writing, design) often involves emotional expressiveness and Openness. Technical or problem-solving creativity (engineering, software) may involve the Intellect facet of Openness (analytical innovation) ￼ ￼. We will capture this by asking about both artistic/ aesthetic imagination and analytical problem-solving creativity.

Measurement: Several validated scales exist. For example, Williams’ Creative Aptitude Test (WCAT) measures creative personality traits like challenge-seeking and imagination ￼ ￼. The Creative Achievement Questionnaire (CAQ) assesses self-reported creative accomplishments. For personality-based questions, items like “I often generate many ideas before choosing one” or “I enjoy finding new solutions to problems” could be used. Divergent thinking tasks (e.g. listing uses for an object) are also indicators, but more time-consuming. We will likely use a self-report scale focusing on trait creativity.

Differences in Creative Professionals: Research shows creative professionals score higher on creative measures than non-creatives ￼. In Benedek et al. (2024), musicians and actors had greater divergent thinking ability, higher Openness, and stronger creative identity than controls ￼. They were driven by intrinsic passion for creativity and growth mindset, as well as extrinsic recognition. They also rejected “creativity myths,” showing more realistic creative self-concepts ￼. In practice, we expect many artists to report high creativity and novelty preference, balanced by practical traits (e.g. moderate Conscientiousness).

Indicators/Questions: Potential items include: “I frequently think of unique ways to complete tasks.” “I am motivated by a passionate interest in creative work” (a nod to passion for creativity ￼). We may also ask about creative self-efficacy (e.g. “I believe I can solve problems in novel ways”). Behaviorally, one could rate prior creative outputs or willingness to engage in brainstorming. This dimension will be scored along a continuum from “conventional thinkers” to “highly innovative, experimental thinkers.”

Risk Appetite (New Dimension)

Definition: Risk Appetite measures one’s comfort with uncertainty and tendency to take chances in work and life. High scorers are willing to pursue novel opportunities despite potential failure. It reflects a preference for challenge and tolerance for ambiguity or potential loss.

Psychological Basis: Risk tolerance in personality is often assessed via sensation-seeking or reward-sensitivity. Gray’s Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory posits a Behavioral Approach System (BAS) that governs reward-seeking/risk-taking. Carver & White’s BAS scale, and Zuckerman’s Sensation-Seeking Scale (SSS), tap into similar constructs: thrill/adventure seeking, novelty-seeking, and impulsivity ￼. Research links high BAS/sensation-seeking to entrepreneurship and creative risk-taking. Conversely, high Neuroticism or high BIS (Behavioral Inhibition System) leads to risk aversion.

Measurement: We can adapt items from DOSPERT (Domain-Specific Risk-Taking) or sensation-seeking scales. Sample items: “I prefer projects where I can try new methods even if they might fail.” “I am willing to leave a secure job if a more exciting opportunity arises.” Behavioral indicators include history of career changes, preference for high-stakes tasks, or comfort with rapid innovation cycles.

Relevance: Risk tolerance predicts who thrives in entrepreneurial or high-innovation roles. Creative industries often reward risk-taking (e.g. experimenting with unconventional art). In corporate settings, innovators need courage to challenge norms. However, excessive risk-taking can lead to burnout or reckless mistakes, especially under stress. Notably, acute stress can alter risk preferences: one study found stress blunted sensitivity to positive outcomes, making people **not significantly more risk-seeking overall ￼. This suggests we should consider stability vs. stress influences.

Stress Interaction: We include a complementary “Usual vs. Stressed” profile (below) rather than altering the risk scale under stress. However, we note that stress often leads individuals to become more cautious of rewards ￼. We might incorporate scenario items: “When I’m under deadline pressure, I take fewer creative risks.”

Indicators/Questions: Possible prompts: “I often take calculated risks if I believe they will pay off.” or “I feel energized by venturing into unknown territory.” We may also ask about attitudes: “I see failure as a learning step rather than a setback.” and check consistency of responses under neutral vs. stress conditions. A high score indicates a comfort with uncertainty and novelty; low score indicates preferance for safety and predictability.

Values & Motivation (New Dimension)

Definition: This dimension captures an individual’s core work values and motivations – what they truly care about in their work. It includes intrinsic motivators (e.g. autonomy, mastery, purpose) and extrinsic ones (e.g. security, recognition).

Theoretical Frameworks: We draw on established theories: Schwartz’s Values Theory identifies universal human values (e.g. Self-Direction/Autonomy, Achievement, Security, etc.) ￼. Self-Determination Theory (SDT) distinguishes intrinsic vs. extrinsic motivation: work that satisfies Autonomy, Competence, and Relatedness needs fosters intrinsic motivation and engagement ￼ ￼. Daniel Pink’s popular model (autonomy, mastery, purpose) resonates with these scholarly models. Other work-value models (e.g. Rokeach, Super) enumerate constructs like Creativity, Prestige, Altruism, and Independence.

Core Work Values: Based on research and practitioner sources, key values include Autonomy (independence in work), Mastery (growth/skill development), Purpose (meaning of work), Security (job stability), and Recognition (appreciation, status). Schwartz’s Self-Direction and Stimulation align with autonomy and novelty; Security and Conformity with stability; Achievement and Power with success and recognition. SDT research shows that when people’s jobs fulfill autonomy and competence, satisfaction and performance rise ￼ ￼.

Values in Creatives vs. Corporate: Creative professionals typically prioritize Openness-to-Change values (Self-Direction, Stimulation, Creativity) and purpose. Lebedeva et al. (2019) found that people high in creative achievement endorse Openness (e.g. autonomy, novelty) and reject Conservation values (security/conformity) ￼. By contrast, corporate-oriented individuals often rank Conservation/Achievement values (security, conformity, prestige) more highly. For example, agency managers might emphasize reliable results and career advancement, whereas artists emphasize freedom and self-expression.

Measurement: We can include a values inventory (short Schwartz or work-values scale). Example items: “Having freedom to choose how I do my work is very important to me.” (Self-Direction). “I need my work to have a clear, positive impact on others.” (Purpose/Universalism). “I prefer jobs with clear rules and stability.” (Security/Conformity). “Being recognized for good work motivates me.” (Recognition/Achievement). We might allow rank-ordering of value statements or Likert ratings.

Indicators: We will score these to reveal a values profile. For instance, high “Autonomy” and low “Security” scores indicate a “Creative-Value orientation” (valuing independence over stability), which may guide career coaching (e.g. suggesting agile environments). Notably, values are contextual: a person might value autonomy at work but still desire financial security, so we will measure multiple dimensions.

Relevance: Assessing values helps match individuals to environments and roles. A graphic designer might score high on Autonomy and Creativity, while a corporate legal counsel might score high on Security and Conformity. Recognizing these differences can guide career advice (e.g. suggesting project-based vs. structured jobs) and team formation. No single personality test fully captures values, so this addition is innovative and grounded in SDT/Schwartz theory ￼ ￼.

Work Style Preference (New Dimension)

Definition: This dimension assesses preferred working conditions and processes – how an individual likes to work. It covers factors like pace (fast vs. steady), structure (clear routine vs. flexibility), autonomy (independent vs. directed), social versus solo work, and sensory environment (open-office vs. quiet).

Research & Frameworks: The Person–Environment Fit literature and Job Characteristics Model highlight that the match between personal work style and environment affects satisfaction and performance. Key factors include Autonomy (freedom vs. control) and Task Variety/Structure. For example, Hackman & Oldham’s model posits that autonomy and task identity increase motivation. Empirical studies find that Conscientiousness thrives under structured conditions, whereas more spontaneous styles like NP (MBTI) prefer flexibility. Social energy is also critical: extroverts prefer collaborative settings, introverts quiet spaces ￼.

Environmental Preferences: Specific work-style aspects include:
	•	Pace: Fast-paced/changing vs. slow/steady work demands.
	•	Structure: Highly structured roles (clear rules, schedules) vs. fluid roles (ad-hoc tasks).
	•	Autonomy: Independent decision-making vs. directed management.
	•	Social vs. Solo: Preference for teamwork and brainstorming vs. solitary concentration.
	•	Sensory Setting: Preference for busy open offices vs. quiet/private spaces.

Measurement: We will include items gauging these preferences. For example: “I am most productive when I can organize my own schedule (autonomy).” “I prefer knowing exactly what is expected rather than figuring it out on the fly (structure).” “I enjoy working in open-plan or noisy environments (social/sensory).” Each will be rated on a scale. We may also use existing instruments (e.g. Crom’s Work Environment Preference Scale) for inspiration.

Importance & Fit: Research suggests fitting work style to personality boosts satisfaction. For instance, one study noted extroverts thrive in social roles while introverts prefer solitary work ￼. Another review found open offices benefit extroverts but harm introverts/Highly Sensitive people ￼ ￼. Autistic individuals, for example, often prefer quiet, low-stimulus settings ￼ ￼. We will use these findings to inform our interpretation: e.g., an introverted creative with high sensory sensitivity may do best in a remote or quiet studio environment ￼ ￼.

Potential Questions: Sample items: “I prefer a work environment with clear procedures and minimal surprises.” (Structure) “I am comfortable collaborating in large teams.” (Social). “I do my best work in a quiet, private space.” (Sensory). We will combine responses into sub-scales (pace/structure, social vs. solo, sensory environment), which can be used to suggest compatible workplaces (e.g. “you flourish in autonomous, low-distraction settings”).

MBTI Integration (Secondary Classification)

Although MBTI is not used for the main trait scoring, we include it as a secondary cognitive-style layer. This section synthesizes the literature on MBTI and Big Five correlations, and outlines responsible use.

Correlation Research: Numerous studies have mapped MBTI dichotomies onto Big Five traits. Meta-analytic findings (McCrae & Costa 1988, Furnham et al.) consistently show:
	•	Extraversion–Introversion (E–I) ⇔ Big Five Extraversion ￼
	•	Sensing–Intuition (S–N) ⇔ Big Five Openness/Intellect ￼
	•	Thinking–Feeling (T–F) ⇔ Big Five Agreeableness (Warmth/Compassion) ￼
	•	Judging–Perceiving (J–P) ⇔ Big Five Conscientiousness ￼

For example, Renner et al. (2014) found the strongest match: MBTI E with Big5 Extraversion, P with Conscientiousness, F with Agreeableness, N with Openness ￼. MBTI has no dimension corresponding to Neuroticism, as its dichotomies focus on information-processing. Studies also note mixed validity: MBTI test–retest reliability is poor (nearly half get different results on retesting) and it lacks predictive power for job performance ￼. These criticisms mirror those in the professional literature, cautioning against overinterpreting MBTI as science.

Predicting MBTI from Big Five: Given the above mappings, one can estimate MBTI preferences from Big Five scores. For instance, high Openness/Intellect suggests an Intuitive preference, high Extraversion suggests “E,” and so on. Some researchers (McCrae & Costa; Furnham) have successfully created conversion algorithms ￼. We will apply a similar approach: after computing Big Five proxies for each user, we can assign likely MBTI letters (e.g. if a user’s scores indicate very high Extraversion and moderate Conscientiousness, they might be “ENTP” or “ENFP” depending on Agreeableness). However, we will treat this as a probabilistic preference rather than a hard label.

Criticisms & Responsible Use: The MBTI’s scientific limitations are well-documented. Many psychologists label it “pseudoscience” due to its categorical (type) model and lack of reliability ￼. However, MBTI has enduring popularity and can serve as a framework for self-reflection (especially the ‘functions’ narrative). We will use MBTI responsibly by:
	•	Presenting types as interpretive shorthand (“This profile aligns most with the ENTP style: you are curious, idea-driven, and flexible”), but emphasizing overlap and uniqueness (“no one is 100% one type”).
	•	Not using MBTI for hiring/selection at all (only as an optional insight).
	•	Providing balanced context: e.g. noting critics’ views in the help text (MBTI is one of many lenses).
	•	Highlighting how MBTI frames cognitive styles (e.g. thinking vs. feeling) can complement trait feedback.
In practice, we’ll report MBTI type at the end, with disclaimers: “About 30% probability you identify as an INTJ; this suggests you prefer strategic planning and efficiency, but most people fluctuate in different situations.” and link to normal variation.

Creative vs. Corporate MBTI Tendencies: Anecdotally, many creative professionals lean toward Intuitive and Perceiving types (e.g. INFP, ENFP) emphasizing imagination and flexibility ￼. For instance, MBTI practitioner research indicates ADHD correlates with Intuition/Perceiving preferences ￼, which are common in artistic minds. We will note such trends (e.g. “Artists often prefer N/P types, valuing novelty and adaptability”). However, we will not pigeonhole any user; MBTI output is purely supplementary.

Best Practices: We will present MBTI results as “style insights,” not as personality truth. For example, we might say “Your dominant traits match ENFP: creative, people-oriented, flexible. This is one valid way to look at your profile, but remember it’s just one perspective.” We’ll also suggest pairing each MBTI letter with trait scores (e.g. “Your high agreeableness and extraversion align with many ‘Feeling’ types”). Importantly, we will encourage use of MBTI for personal insight (communication tips, self-reflection) not as a definitive label.

Neurodivergence-Friendly Design

To ensure fairness for neurodivergent individuals (especially ADHD and Autism), we incorporate both content and design considerations:

Neurodivergent Profiles: Research on Big Five traits in neurodivergent groups shows consistent patterns. Adults with ADHD tend to have higher Neuroticism (emotional volatility) and lower Extraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness ￼. High Neuroticism/low Conscientiousness reflect impulsivity and distractibility. On the autism spectrum, the meta-analysis found extremely low Extraversion (strong introversion) and reduced Conscientiousness and Openness ￼. These tendencies mean that standard personality items (which assume certain social or detail-oriented norms) may yield very different response profiles for neurodivergent people.

Pitfalls of Standard Tests: Typical personality questionnaires can inadvertently disadvantage neurodivergent respondents. For example:
	•	Literal interpretation: Autistic individuals may interpret abstract or metaphorical items too literally, leading to inaccuracies.
	•	Attention demands: ADHD responders might struggle with lengthy surveys or lose focus, affecting reliability.
	•	Negative framing: Standard scales often have reverse-coded items or assume sociability is “good”; this can pathologize neurodivergent traits.
A Reddit user noted that tests felt “very neurotypical and anti-neurodivergent” and that daily variability made results unreliable ￼. Another pointed out that forced structure can make them “chaffing” (uncomfortable) and looked forward to leaving test questions undone ￼.

Design Recommendations:
	•	Language: Use plain, concrete wording. Avoid idioms (e.g. “think on your feet”) or double-negatives. Short, direct statements help all users.
	•	Format: Break the test into short sections. Allow skipping and returning to items. Offer text-to-speech or visual aids if possible.
	•	Neutrality: Frame questions positively and neutrally. For example, instead of “I often get distracted”, say “Sometimes I focus better by moving around or taking breaks.” (giving legitimacy to activity).
	•	Focus on Strengths: Emphasize positive descriptions. For ADHD, for instance, MBTI guidance highlights creativity and hyperfocus as strengths ￼. We will mirror this by including items like “I can concentrate deeply on tasks I care about.”
	•	Accommodations: Clearly state that accommodations are available (e.g. extra time, screen reader). Provide practice items to familiarize with format. Ensure compatibility with assistive tools.
	•	Inclusive Norms: Avoid questions that assume everyone is social or thrives in change. For instance, balance items like “I enjoy large team discussions” with “I prefer working in a small, calm environment.” This allows introverts/autistic users to endorse the second without penalty.

We will not explicitly test for ADHD/autism (those are clinical domains), but will accommodate these traits. For example, questions about focus or rigidity will be posed neutrally to let neurodivergent patterns emerge naturally. The aim is a neuro-inclusive assessment: one user suggested that giving quiet options and flexible pacing makes such tests more accessible ￼. We’ll strive to build in those options (e.g. “Would you like to answer some questions by listening rather than reading?”).

Work Environment & Culture Fit

Key Factors: Empirical studies identify several work environment factors that drive satisfaction and performance. Autonomy (freedom in how to do work), task significance and feedback (from Job Characteristics Theory), as well as supportive leadership and social support are robust positive predictors ￼ ￼. For example, SDT research shows satisfaction peaks when competence and autonomy needs are met ￼. Agreeable and conscientious people report higher satisfaction in general ￼. By contrast, high Neuroticism consistently predicts lower satisfaction and well-being at work ￼.

Personality–Environment Match: Classic fit models (e.g. Holland’s RIASEC) suggest some fit, but rigorous reviews find only modest effects ￼. One meta-analysis concluded personality–job congruence had surprisingly little impact on performance or happiness ￼. Instead, environmental conditions themselves (engaging tasks, good team culture) matter more ￼. Nonetheless, we incorporate match suggestions qualitatively: e.g. extroverts in roles with frequent collaboration, detail-oriented people in structured roles.

Sensory & Social Factors: Sensory environment research shows that office design impacts well-being by personality: Open-plan offices benefit extroverts but hinder introverts and highly sensitive individuals ￼ ￼. For example, one study noted “open-plan offices only suit extroverts; they are not a good fit for introverts and highly sensitive people” ￼. Introverts tend to prefer private or quiet workspaces, and neurotic individuals often choose to work remotely to control sensory input ￼ ￼. We will ask about these preferences explicitly (e.g. “I prefer a quiet workspace away from noise”).

Remote vs. In-Person: Flexibility in work mode has grown in importance. While formal studies are emerging, general advice is that introverts often prefer remote or individual work settings, whereas extroverts may seek in-person collaboration. We will include items like “I enjoy working from home or alone” vs. “I thrive in face-to-face brainstorming sessions.” Survey feedback suggests digital surveys themselves can help ADHD/ASD by allowing pacing, so we echo that with flexible format options.

Utility for Fit: By combining personality scores with work-style preferences, the tool can suggest ideal environments. For example, a high-Conscientiousness, low-Openness person might prefer a structured office with clear deadlines. A high-Openness, low-Conscientious creative might do better in a flexible startup atmosphere. We will generate statements such as “You likely excel in environments that reward autonomy and creativity.” and “You may find highly routine tasks tedious; look for roles with varied projects.” These fit insights will be grounded in research: e.g. knowledge that autonomy and supportive culture predict engagement ￼ ￼.

Creative Professionals vs. Corporate Differences

Personality Profiles: Studies comparing artists/designers/writers to corporate workers consistently find creativity differences. Creative professionals score higher in Openness, divergent thinking, and creative self-concept ￼. Benedek et al. (2024) found musicians/actors had significantly higher divergent thinking ability and Openness than non-artists ￼. They also reported “intrinsic passion for creativity” as a stronger motive. Corporate roles (managers, engineers) often involve higher Conscientiousness and Agreeableness for process and teamwork, and value stability and efficiency more than artistic novelty.

Values and Motivation: Aligning with this, creative individuals emphasize autonomy, self-expression and learning (SDT’s intrinsic motivators) ￼ ￼. Corporate professionals more often cite mastery of domain and external rewards (salary, recognition) as motivators. For instance, artists scored high on Growth/Openness Schwartz values and low on Conservation (security) values ￼. We will reflect this by comparing an individual’s values profile to typical creative vs. corporate patterns (anonymously).

Work Environments: Creatives often work project-based, in flexible, collaborative teams (e.g. design studios), whereas corporate creatives may operate within hierarchical structures. Thus, the tool might note: “Creative innovators tend to flourish in flexible, collaborative environments; rigid corporate hierarchies may feel restrictive. Look for teams that encourage experimentation.” This aligns with user report that agency creatives valued “creative freedom and recognition” over routine.

Trait Differences: Some research specifically on creative worker traits (e.g. in advertising) shows they are more open, exploratory, and self-directed than their more technical colleagues ￼. We will incorporate this by highlighting traits especially relevant for artists (Imaginative, Passionate) and noting how they differ from, say, an engineer (detail-focused, systematic). For example: “As a highly imaginative thinker (Openness), you share profiles common among designers and writers ￼.” Conversely, “High Conscientiousness may suit a corporate analyst’s role, but your moderate score suggests you work best when some flexibility is allowed.”.

Stress & Resilience (Usual vs. Stressed Profiles)

Concept: Inspired by the Birkman Method and research on “behavior under stress,” we will offer dual profiles: how you operate normally vs. under pressure. The literature shows personality expressions can shift under stress. For instance, trait anxiety/neuroticism becomes more pronounced under stress. Low Conscientiousness people may become chaotic; low Agreeableness may become irritable.

Scientific Backing: Meta-analyses link high Neuroticism to poorer stress resilience ￼. The Birkman Method’s unique dual-profile (Usual vs. Stressful behavior) is marketed on the idea that stress reverses preferences (e.g. a calm person may become hurried under pressure). While formal studies of this specific concept are limited, research on burnout indicates that stress-changes predict risk: persons who score low on stress tolerance (high Neuroticism) are more prone to burnout. We will use stress items to gauge likely changes: e.g. “Under tight deadlines, I become more detail-focused (even if I usually focus on big picture)”. These will highlight potential stress-driven behaviors (e.g. avoidance, aggression, rigidity).

Predictive Value: Evidence on how well stress-profiles predict outcomes is mixed, but we know that incongruence (big differences between usual and stressed selves) can signal risk. We will include an indicator of “stress vulnerability”: people whose feedback indicates they flip strongly under stress might be advised to seek supportive roles or stress-management strategies. For example: “Under stress, you report feeling () and acting () , whereas normally you are (__).”

Dimension Interaction: We’ll examine, for example, if Extroverts become more withdrawn under stress, or if highly Conscientious people panic. The Birkman dual-profile can be approximated by comparing high-Stress Neuroticism. We’ll not assign separate traits but we’ll reflect stress effects narratively: “Although you are normally confident (High Assertiveness), in high-pressure situations you may become more tentative. Building resilience strategies will help maintain your usual performance.”.

Archetype Systems & Type Classifications

Number of Types: There is no consensus on “optimal” number of personality categories. Common systems range from 4 to 16 types. We will lean toward dimensional scores over rigid types, but offer an optional archetype interpretation for those who find it useful.
	•	Archetype Count: In line with frameworks like Jung’s 8 cognitive functions or classic four temperaments, an 8–12 category scheme often balances nuance with usability. (For instance, the Enneagram’s 9, or MBTI’s 16, or branding archetypes often 8–12). We suggest 8 archetypes for this tool, combining core dimensions into meaningful profiles (e.g. “Innovator,” “Caretaker,” “Analyst,” etc.). This is somewhat arbitrary but ensures each archetype has distinct trait patterns. Research on creative-brain archetypes suggests multiple domains (visionary, executor, etc.).
	•	Types vs. Dimensions: We will emphasize that any typology is just one way to interpret scores. Evidence shows categorical typing loses nuance and reliability ￼. However, types can aid understanding if used gently. We will thus provide archetype labels as descriptive summaries, not hard assignments. For example: “Your profile is closest to the ‘Innovator’ archetype: high in Novelty-Seeking and Imagination but lower on routine tasks.” Users will see their underlying dimension scores and can align with or deviate from the archetype narrative.

Existing Systems – Pros and Cons:
	•	MBTI (16 types): Popular and conceptually rich, but criticized for dichotomous invalidity ￼. We only use MBTI in passing as cognitive style (see above).
	•	Enneagram (9 types): Focuses on motivation dynamics (good for self-awareness), but often seen as esoteric. We may mention it for context but not build into scoring.
	•	16Personalities: A modern MBTI-derivative often found online; provides a user-friendly narrative but suffers from the same scientific issues.
	•	Brand or Jungian Archetypes (8–12): E.g. “Hero, Creator, Sage,” which can feel relatable for some creatives (branding often uses these). If we include archetypes, they should be clearly connected to trait scores (e.g. Creative types always score high on Creativity dimension).

We will likely define archetypes based on our own composite logic (e.g. combining high Assertiveness+Conscientiousness = “Leader”; high Creativity+Flexibility = “Visionary”). We’ll ensure they resonate with creative communities (names like Artist, Strategist, Catalyst, Stabilizer, etc.).

For Creative Professionals: We will include archetypes that appeal to creativity. For example, an archetype “The Creator” (high creativity and passion) vs. “The Craftsman” (high detail-oriented focus) vs. “The Connector” (social influencer). We’ll warn that not everyone fits neatly: “People often mix traits from multiple archetypes. Your profile shows elements of ‘Innovator’ and ‘Analyst’, which is common.”

Handling Ambiguity: If a user’s scores are evenly spread, we will avoid forcing one archetype; instead we might say “You display a blend of X and Y patterns.” This addresses the user complaint that tests put them in “tiny boxes” ￼. We will provide descriptions from multiple angles and encourage users to see themselves flexibly.

User Experiences & Feedback (Forum Research)

We conducted a deep dive into user discussions (Reddit, forums) about popular personality tests to extract themes for our design. The findings reveal clear patterns in what users like, dislike, and feel is missing.

1. Summary of User Experiences

Users are divided on personality assessments. Many enjoy the self-exploration aspects: they find personality reports interesting, and often share results with friends. For example, one user said, “It helped me understand my friends better… we all talked about our results. We all know how it feels to be misunderstood, so I was incredibly grateful… to speak each other’s language.” ￼. Team-building contexts sometimes make tests fun and insightful.

Others are skeptical or frustrated. Common sentiments include: “I LOATHE this stuff… I do well at my job, so why waste time with this?” ￼, and “These tests seem very neurotypical and anti-neurodivergent.” ￼. Some participants game the tests to get desired outcomes (e.g. answering for the “best” personality) ￼ ￼. Many criticize perceived inaccuracy: “I can get any result and I wouldn’t be lying. This is ridiculous.” ￼.

2. What Users Love
	•	Communication Tips: Users appreciate when tests offer guidance, not just labels. “I especially like that many [tests] give tips on how to communicate with different types of people.” ￼. Sharing results can improve team understanding of each other.
	•	Self-awareness: Some find test results validating or comforting. One commented “I love them… I find them comforting, not anxiety-inducing.” ￼. Many who enjoy tests treat them like horoscopes: “I love these tests… take what you want from it, discard the rest.” ￼, viewing them flexibly.
	•	Fun & Engagement: In low-stakes settings (team workshops), users report enjoying the discussion. “We all shared results… moving forward [communication] was so much better” ￼. Even fans of more esoteric systems (Enneagram, MBTI) find value in exploring characters or writing personas.

3. What Users Criticize
	•	Vagueness & Subjectivity: A recurring complaint is that test questions and feedback are too broad. In one Reddit thread a user said, “the questions are very abstract… Subjective? Yup. I can answer both ways… this is ridiculous.” ￼. People resent feedback they see as generic or contradictory.
	•	Pseudoscience & Validity: Many openly distrust the legitimacy. Comments like “Gosh how I loathe this pseudoscientific nonsense” ￼ and equating MBTI with astrology reflect this. They warn against using tests for serious decisions.
	•	Misuse in Hiring: A common fear is tests being used to screen or pigeonhole people. Users advise gaming the answers to appear more favorable, e.g. “I just answer to get the results I want… I made sure to have that [preferred] personality.” ￼. Several say they refuse to disclose personal diagnoses and resent questions as intrusive or irrelevant ￼.
	•	Lack of Nuance: People feel standard tests ignore day-to-day variation or context. “My chaos… can’t even predict how I’ll work best from one day to another.” ￼. One user notes tests ignore neurodivergent realities, making them feel misrepresented.

4. Gaps Identified
	•	Depth & Personalization: Users often wish reports delved deeper than the 5-10 pages of fluff common in online profiles. They want concrete examples and tailored advice (beyond generic “Teamwork suits you”).
	•	Creativity Focus: Creative professionals frequently note that mainstream tests miss artistic traits (imagination, aesthetic sensitivity). For example, a comment on a “creative type” quiz noted it didn’t capture any meaningful insight. We found no specific quotes, but this was a repeated theme in creative forums.
	•	Neurodiversity: A major gap is inclusivity. Neurodivergent users lament that tests assume social norms and consistency, which may not apply to them. They want design that accounts for different cognitive styles (e.g. more concrete questions, allowance for unique thinking).
	•	Alternative Predictors: Some users mention that skills/aptitudes matter more for jobs than personality (“What matters more is aptitude… how good you are at something” ￼). They crave integration of abilities assessment, though that is beyond our current scope.

5. Quotes & Examples
	•	“I love these tests… Take what you want/need from it, and discard the rest. [As a team-building tool] Great!” ￼ – positive feedback on using results for communication.
	•	“They all seemed rather undefining and vague… I can answer both answers at any time… This is ridiculous.” ￼ – frustration with vague questions.
	•	“I LOATHE this pseudoscientific nonsense… I’ll just say I’m a Gemini because it’s the same level of BS.” ￼ ￼ – anger at perceived lack of rigor.
	•	“I did a few in training… I got identical results to another autistic woman… It helps explain my neurodiversity better to NT coworkers.” ￼ – note on it aiding neurodiversity communication.
	•	“It should be optional, not forced. [In the workplace] it’s cute when it’s on your side, but not when it’s not.” ￼ – warning against mandatory use.

6. Creative Professionals’ Perspective

Although direct forum posts from artists on general personality sites are rare, some hints emerge. Creative users often try specialized tests (e.g. Adobe’s Creative Type). In one discussion, an INTJ user complained the “Creative Types” quiz was “subjective… I can get any result… This is ridiculous.” ￼. This suggests creative people demand clarity and relevance: they won’t accept stereotypes. They also value authenticity: forced profiles or Jargon turn them off. In advice threads, creatives emphasize passion, purpose, and autonomy in career satisfaction (echoing our value findings). They want a tool that respects artistic identity, e.g. by acknowledging that a painter might be introverted or a coder extroverted – so our tool’s multi-dimensional approach (vs. single label) should resonate.

7. Design Recommendations from Users

Synthesizing user feedback leads to practical design tips:
	•	Interactive & Flexible Format: Break tests into small sections with progress indicators, allow skipping and returning, and offer different input modes (rating vs. situational judgment) to maintain engagement (especially for ADHD users ￼).
	•	Contextualize Results: Instead of giving absolute statements, present outcomes as guides. For example: “It seems you prefer ideas over routine (Openness high)… how does that match your experience?” This mirrors the “take what you need” approach ￼.
	•	Actionable Insights: Emphasize practical advice derived from scores. If someone scores high on Assertiveness, we might suggest leadership opportunities; if high on Social energy, encourage networking; if low on sensory tolerance, suggest noise-cancelling or flexible location options. Users appreciated tests giving communication tips ￼.
	•	Strengths-Based Language: Frame answers positively. Instead of “You struggle with…”, use “You excel at…” even when describing deficits. For ADHD/Autistic-friendly design, highlight strengths like “Your curiosity and big-picture thinking are assets.” (the MBTI ADHD guide notes creativity as an ADHD strength ￼).
	•	User Agency: Clearly state that there are no “wrong” profiles, and encourage users to consider which parts of the report fit. Include disclaimers similar to “Your personality is more than any test” to reduce defensiveness ￼.
	•	Visual & Clear UI: Use simple layouts, readable fonts, and avoid sensory overload in the UI. Some users mention requiring quiet environments to concentrate ￼, so our digital interface should not flash or move unexpectedly.
	•	Length and Depth: While thoroughness is valued, long unwieldy reports frustrate users. We should keep each section concise (the user requested “not too shallow” but actionable). Aim for clarity over volume.

By incorporating these user-driven insights—clear guidance, flexible interpretation, and inclusivity—we will design an assessment that feels meaningful and respectful to real people.
